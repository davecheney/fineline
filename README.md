fineline
========

fineline is a line editing package for the [Go programming language](http://golang.org).
It's written entirely in Go; it doesn't wrap readline, libedit, or anything else.

This is still pretty experimental and buggy. Windows support is partially
working, but still has some kinks to work out.
