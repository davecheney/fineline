fineline
========

fineline is a line editing package for the [Go programming language](http://golang.org).
It's written entirely in Go; it doesn't wrap readline, libedit, or anything else.

This is still pretty experimental and probably has bugs. Windows support is coming,
but there's a really good chance it's not there yet -- I haven't even tested the
code.
